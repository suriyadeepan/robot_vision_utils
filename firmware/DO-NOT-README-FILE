-> trying to compile a simple program (led blinking)
	which includes <avr/io.h> header with gcc

-> compiled LED blink program (900 ms) (led_blink.c) 
	with -Os optimization and obtained led_blink.hex
		

-> Adjusted the FCPU value in led_blink.c based on FUSE
	

-> Uploaded the led_blink.hex to uC (atmega16-> dev board)
	using avrdude
